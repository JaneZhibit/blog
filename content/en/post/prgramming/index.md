By now, a huge number of different programming languages have appeared. Some of them are related to each other, some have fundamental differences, but they all have their own disadvantages, and most importantly, advantages.

Everyone, of course, knows about the languages Python, C#, C++, Java and JavaScript. These are some of the most commonly recognized languages that many people now speak. 

It seems that they are the ones that scientists should use in their research, but it turns out that this is not entirely true. 

As a rule, the mentioned languages are useful in mobile development, data analysis, working with the browser and other commercial developments, but scientists often need something else.

1. Of course, Python makes life much easier, because not only has a huge number of libraries already been written for it, but its syntax is also quite simple and understandable. It helps physicists, chemists, mathematicians, biologists, and economists in solving a variety of problems.

2. Fortran is the first high-level language used by people of different professions. It is well-debugged for mathematical calculations and solving equations, and is relevant in many respects to economics and biology.

3. Julia takes the best of languages like Python, Ruby, Lisp and R, combines it with the speed of C, and includes familiar math notation like Matlab. 
It is a good enough language for general programming and at the same time amazing for specific computer science disciplines such as machine learning, data mining, distributed and parallel computing. One of the main advantages of Julia is its speed, comparable to languages such as C, Rust, Lua and Go. This is because it is compiled using the Just-In-Time (JIT) principle.

4. MATLAB is a proprietary programming language used by millions of engineers and scientists for mathematical and statistical computing. Data scientists primarily use this language for data analysis and machine learning. The best part is that you have everything in one workspace. It is used primarily in academic circles, but is still a great choice for building a deep foundation of data science concepts. The only downside of MATLAB is that it is a paid software, so you will use this language mainly if you are studying at university or already using it at your job. Check out the official list of MathWorks resources to get started today.


As you can see, many languages have their own characteristics and it is important to understand the specific task at hand in order to choose the right language and complete the job as efficiently as possible.
