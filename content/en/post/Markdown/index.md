Markdown is one of the most famous markup languages; it belongs to the group of lightweight languages, that is, it is easy to understand and master, and contains a minimal set of functions. This language is also compatible with a huge number of editors.

It was developed in 2004 by John Gruber.

So, we list the main advantages of this language:
- Versatility
Ability to open in any editor.
- Simplicity
Easy to understand and easy to learn.
- Easy convertibility
Easy export to many formats

When getting acquainted with Markdown, you should definitely look at its syntax and the basic rules for working with it.

1. To work with headers, you need the # symbol. The level of headings is adjusted by the number of #.
To create a paragraph, simply leave a blank line.

2. The text can also take different forms.
- For italic text you can use * or _ on both sides: *example*, _example_
- For bold text you can use ** or __ on both sides: **example**, __example__
- Using ~~ will make the text strikethrough: ~~example~~

3. To work with lists, you can use either - or numbers, to create levels - add 4 spaces to the beginning

4. Links can be created in 2 ways:
  1. [Title](Link itself)
  2. <Link>
 
5. Pictures are formatted as follows:
![title](path to image){#footnote width}, the footnote is formatted like this: (fig. [-@footnote]).

6. In addition, to format the code you can use
- `code` for a line of code
- ```code``` for a block of code
- ```language name - for code highlighting

7. Quotes and their gradation are carried out using the symbol > and its number before the text

8. It is also possible to design tables (columns separated by |, header by line ----), checkboxes [x] / []

It is important to note that not all features of the language are described here, and not all editors support all these features, which must be taken into account when working with it.

So, in this article, we learned a little about the lightweight markdown language Markdown, its advantages and basic syntax.
