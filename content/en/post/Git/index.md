There are many version control systems, they all have their own characteristics, but in this article we will look at Git.

This system appeared in 2005, author - Linus Torvalds.

Git is a free version control system that tracks all changes made to files and stores them all in history. This is a distributed system, so changes are located both in the shared storage and on local devices.

This system appeared in 2005, author - Linus Torvalds.

With its help, it is much more convenient for several people to work on one project, since it is easy to control all changes.

So, let's write down the main advantages of this system
1. Collaboration
2. Track changes
3. Backup
4. Good compatibility with other development tools
5. Convenient access to code
6. Convenient work with branches
7. Security

To work with git, you need to know the basic commands and install it. After that, you usually need to go through basic authentication and continue working.

Also, when talking about git, it's worth mentioning github. 
This is a specially developed web service designed for hosting repositories (projects). With it you can have access to all projects no matter where you are.

This was basic information about the distributed version control system Git, where we learned what it is, why it is needed, its main advantages and more.
